== About ==

The aim is to provide a library that allows programs to transparently read
sequence data from multiple file formats, without having to worry about the
format.  Pass a file to seq_file_open() and then read sequences using
seq_file_read() without having to worry about what the file format is.  

Currently supports:
- SAM & BAM
- FASTA (& gzipped fasta)
- FASTQ (& gzipped fastq)
- 'plain' format (one sequence per line) (& gzipped plain)

== Build ==
To build the test code:

$ make

== Development ==
